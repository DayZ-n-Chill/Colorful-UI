## MESSAGE FROM THE AUTHOR:
All the code I used I took from the Vanilla DayZ files, and moddified them properly myself. 
There is no stolen code in here. All the asshats who have been selling you UI's for years 
have just been "illegally" selling you thier slightly modified vanilla code. 

STOP PAYING FOR DAYZ MODS!!!
Paid Mods Destroy the community.
