## Open Source:  
Lets build together. This project is open source under MIT Licsence. If you have things you would like to see improve on this template base. Send me a pull request on GITHUB.

### Artistic Freedom:  
In addition to the Source Code, there are also some art files. Here is the original PSD file Used to create this layout. Use it to learn more about how I put these layouts together.

## MESSAGE FROM THE AUTHOR:
All the code I used I took from the Vanilla DayZ files, and modified them properly myself. There is no stolen code in here. All the asshats who have been selling you UI's for years have just been "illegally" selling you their slightly modified vanilla code. 

All layouts and designs are 100% unique, and created by me. 

STOP PAYING FOR DAYZ MODS!!!
Paid Mods Destroy the community.
