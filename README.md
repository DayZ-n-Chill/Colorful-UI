## MESSAGE FROM THE AUTHOR:
All the code I used I took from the Vanilla DayZ files, and modified them properly myself. There is no stolen code in here. All the asshats who have been selling you UI's for years have just been "illegally" selling you their slightly modified vanilla code. 

All layouts and designs are 100% unique, and created by me. 

STOP PAYING FOR DAYZ MODS!!!
Paid Mods Destroy the community.
